    <h2>FORESTRY IN UGANDA</h2>
    <P>Forestry is the science and art of creating, managing, conserving, and repairing
         forests and associated 
        resources to meet desired goals, and values for human and environmental benefits </P>

    <p id="">FOREST STATUS IN UGANDA TODAY.</p>
    <P> <img src="Mabira.jpg" alt="" width="25%">
            Trees, forests and woodlands cover about 14% of Uganda’s land surface. Over the
             last 30–40 years, growth in human population and corresponding increase in 
             demand for forest products for domestic and industrial use, expansion of 
             agricultural land, illegal settlements and weak forest management capacity
             have adversely affected the status of natural forests in Uganda, particularly
             the biodiversity. Until recently, little attention had been paid to 
             development of commercial forests which should have provided alternative
             forest products and services to relieve the pressure on natural forests 
             and conserve biodiversity. As a result, Uganda’s forests have been degraded,
              and in some cases, the biodiversity has been eroded. There is a need for 
              regular data collection and monitoring of the status of the forests in
             terms of a real extent, distribution, plantation species introductions
             and biodivers
